# ModelToPredictHousingPrices
This multiple linear regression project aimed to predict housing sales prices using 11 independent variables, selected based on their correlation to sale price from a dataset with 82 columns. Categorical independent variables were transformed into usable data through one-hot encoding. The analysis resulted in an R^2 of 0.88 on the training data and 0.86 on the test data, indicating a strong fit and a good ability to predict housing sales prices. The 11 independent variables used in the model were found to have significant impact on the predicted outcome.
